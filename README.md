# InfiniLore.Photino 
A rework of the [`Photino.Net`](https://github.com/tryphotino/photino.NET) and [`Photino.Blazor`](https://github.com/tryphotino/photino.Blazor) projects.

---

## Status
This project is currently in a *very early stage of development*.

---

## Repo history
This repo was originally forked from [`Photino.NET`](https://github.com/tryphotino/photino.NET) and then the history of the [`Photino.Blazor`](https://github.com/tryphotino/photino.Blazor) repo was merged into this. 
This means that GitHub will only show a reference to the original [`Photino.NET`](https://github.com/tryphotino/photino.NET), though the git history and thus proper attribution of both repos is preserved.

## License
Unlike the other projects in the InfiniLore ecosystem, which all follow GPL or LGPL, this repo follows the same [ Apache-2.0 license file](LICENSE) from [`Photino.NET`](https://github.com/tryphotino/photino.NET) to adhere to the original licensing without the need for extra modifications to the license.
